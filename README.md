**Summary**

This class covers fundamentals of designing & developing cloud-based applications. Students will analyze & compare cloud-based offerings for suitability to specific application & infrastructure needs. They will learn to design, develop, & deploy applications utilizing cloud-based services, and explore legal and ethical issues specific to the cloud-computing environment.

**Class Structure and Topics**

Course instruction will be hybrid with a weekly on-campus class session to review assigned topics and address questions. Students should have completed assigned readings & videos prior to class.

Students can reach me directly throughout the week in the NSC:AD slack team.

This course will cover the following topics, although the precise list & order is subject to revision:

- Overview of cloud computing & cloud-service providers
- Cloud application cost estimation & management
- Core AWS cloud services and development tools
- Designing cloud-computing applications
- Designing cloud data storage
- Designing event-driven cloud applications
- Cloud application containerization
- Cloud application security, monitoring, & scaling
- Cloud application deployment automation
- Introduction to Machine Learning (ML)
- Training, deploying, and tuning ML services on AWS

**Learning Outcomes**

- Familiarity with major cloud service providers and offerings
- Familiar with decision process for designing cloud services based on offerings, pricing, performance, and legal/regulatory considerations
- Competence in creating & managing cloud-hosted web & machine-learning applications

**Course Materials**

This class will use materials from the **AWS Academy** learning system.

This class will also use readings from **Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology, Security, and Architecture, 2nd Edition**, (Thomas Erl and Eric Barceló Monroy) & other materials that students can access free of charge through O’Reilly Online Learning (https://www.oreilly.com/library-access/)

Students will need the following:
- Internet access
- A computer for which student has admin permissions to install necessary software such as https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- An AWS developer account (e.g. https://aws.amazon.com/free)
- An AWS Academy student account
  An AWS SkillBuilder account 
- A https://github.com account

**Grading**

Grades will be based on weekly assignments (85%) and regular quizzes (15%). There is no final exam.

Weekly assignments will be posted on Canvas and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week. Assignments are due by the end of week and assignments completed **up to 2 weeks late will be marked down by 10%**. Assignments completed **more than 2 weeks late will not be accepted for grading**.

You may discuss how to approach solutions with other students in the class or in online forums, but your submission must be your own work. Code submissions that are substantially identical or derived from AI systems would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.
