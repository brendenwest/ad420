- Cloud application security
- Serverless cloud applications
- Cloud application monitoring
- Cloud application deployment automation

**Learning Outcomes**

Familiarity with major cloud service providers and offerings
Familiar with decision process for designing cloud services based on offerings, pricing, performance, and legal/regulatory considerations
Competence in creating & managing cloud-hosted web applications

**Course Materials**

This class will use materials from the AWS Academy learning system.
This class will also use readings from Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology, Security, and Architecture, 2nd Edition, (Thomas Erl and Eric Barceló Monroy) & other materials that students can access free of charge through O’Reilly Online Learning (https://www.oreilly.com/library-access/)
Students will need the following:
- Internet access
- A computer for which student has admin permissions to install necessary software such as https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- An AWS developer account (e.g. https://aws.amazon.com/free)
- A https://github.com account

**Grading**

Grades will be based on weekly assignments (80%) and regular quizzes (20%). There is no final exam.

Weekly assignments will be posted on Canvas and are designed to exercise the skills and concepts covered that week. Assignments are due by the end of week and late submission may be marked down by 10%.

You may discuss how to approach solutions with other students in the class or in online forums, but your submission must be your own work. Code submissions that are substantially identical or derived from AI systems would be considered cheating and subject to a markdown penalty.

Quizzes will be administered via Canvas and must be completed during the specified time frame to receive credit.
